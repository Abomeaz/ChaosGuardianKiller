# ChaosGuardianKiller

Little Project to automate Draconic Evolution Guardian fight. This project has been started for my Youtube series "Minecraft Modd√©".

## TODO

* Make the robot travel from anywhere to the dragon (multiples of 10 000) **done (almost)**
* Make the robot charge itself when it needs it **done**
* Check wether or not the dragon is alive when it arrives to the island
* Break the dragon's shields
* Attack the dragon itself
* Going to the core of the island to break the chaos shard

Currently the main challenge is to find a way for the robot to break the shields. I'm currently looking into using PSI alongside OpenComputers, but we could potentially make the robot check every block arround 10 000 for Shield Blocks. It would be long, but it would work. Feel free to try it out yourself (maybe in a separated branch).

You can submit pull requests, I will review them when I got time.
